version 23w01a (23 = 2023, w01 = week 1 (week one starts at 19/01/23, a = first update of the week)
- AI-Changelog created to track ai development
- Added Environmental Query system (EQS), to allow ai's to obtain 
relevent game data to perform their behaviours. Also supports
pathfinding.
- Added Goal oriented behvaiours, although not planned to be used.
- Added Behaviour Trees, which will be the main ai behavioural
solution.
- Added simple character controller
- Added a EQS Debugger to visualise the system and help other devs
understand what it does
- Added some simple ai animations, although not planned to be used.
- Added temporary player model and test map, although not planned
to be used
- Added AI Pathfinding utilising the EQS. The pathfinding solution
is Dijkstra pathfinding.
- Added a simple melee-ai that chases the player and attempts to melee
attack them.
- Added a more complex ranged ai that pathfinds to optimal locations
and shoots at the player


version 23w02a
-Work begins on the "Pouncer" Ai.
-Work begins on a proper ai design doc
-Basic Pouncer AI complete, will hide from the player until its 
confident enough then will "pounce" the player, before running away
again
-Basic Bombadier AI complete, will attempt to keep distance from
the player, firing arcing grenades / artillery like projectiles.
-Neat camera drift effect added. The camera will try and move between
the player and the mouse position, meaning that the camera slightly
moves to follow the mouse, which creates a cool feeling.
-Added some fun little arms to the player, wont stay in the project 
but adds a little flavour in the mean time
-Added short descriptions / summaries to all scripts.
-Added a quick signature to all code that is made by me(Tom :p)


==Version 23w02b==

New Content:
-AI Design doc started at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xT74x9bICieZsWC87BQR4z7pn51lc6xaj8d3eyfFrmk/edit?usp=sharing
-Basic Stalker AI complete, will hold back at long range and
snipe the player. Will attempt to stay far away from the player.
Will periodically teleport to a new position
-Basic AI Spawner generated. Can take as many AI prefabs as desired,
as well as the count for how many to spawn. Can control the bounds 
of the spawning area.

Changes : 
-Updated movement behaviours to update pathfinding in real time,
allowing for more realisitic movement
-Added little eyes to each AI enemy, as well as tweaked their sizes to give them a bit more character 

Known Bugs : 
-Pouncers can pounce through objects and out of the map boundry
-Some occasional pathfinding failures leading to error throws

===============

==Version 23w03a==

New Content:
- Enemies have new programmer models (look slightly less 
jank)
- Laser pointers (shader included)
- New Behaviours ;
	- Charge shots
	- 3 new movement behaviours
- 
Changes:
-Under the hood overhaul of the player / ai's (seb and Tom)
- Behaviour tree replaced with a binary-behaviour tree
system. This splits the tree into two new trees; The
action tree and the movement tree. The ai's can now 
perform actions and move independently, allowing for
emergent behaviours like running and shooting that 
wasn't possible before.
- Sniper AI and Basic shooter AI reworked under new AI
system
Known bugs : 
- Pathfinding doesn't always suceed, shouldn't pump out errors
from now on

===============

==Version 23w04a==
New Content:
- Slime Boss, complete with a moveset and a simple set piece
to spawn the boss, including :
	- The boss itself, with a slime shader 
	- An intro animation using camera effects, shaders
	etc
	- An overhaul of the teleport action, which a very
	telegraphed and cool looking animation
- New AI attacks
	- Spread shot, fires a spread of projectiles akin to
	a shotgun. Can increase the spread to allow for a 360
	projectile circle.
	- Charge attack. Reworked pounce attack from older
	versions
Changes: 
- Enemies now recieve and deal damage appropriatly
- Charge attack is now fixed, and will no longer charge
through solid objects
Known bugs:
